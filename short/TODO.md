# Task: Replace the music beat with local "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran on "Yes" response

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Update script.js**: Modify the `playRomanticSong()` function to use an HTML `<audio>` element pointing to the local 'Ed Sheeran.mp4' file instead of the YouTube embed.
   - Set autoplay and loop attributes.
   - Hide the audio element.

2. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Use browser_action to launch index.html.
   - Simulate the flow: Enter name, answer questions, select "Yes" on relationship.
   - Verify music starts from the local file (check console for no errors; audio will play invisibly).

3. **Completion**:
   - Confirm success and present result.
